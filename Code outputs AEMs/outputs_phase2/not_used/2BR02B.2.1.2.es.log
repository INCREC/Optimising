ChatCompletionMessage(content='**2BR02B**\n\n*por KURT VONNEGUT, JR.*\n\nTodo estaba perfectamente bien.\n\nNo había prisiones, ni barrios marginales, ni manicomios, ni discapacitados, ni pobreza, ni guerras.\n\nTodas las enfermedades fueron vencidas, también la vejez.\n\nLa muerte, salvo accidentes, era una aventura para voluntarios.\n\nLa población de los Estados Unidos se estabilizó en cuarenta millones de almas.\n\nUna mañana brillante en el Hospital de Maternidad de Chicago, un hombre llamado Edward K. Wehling, Jr., esperaba a que su esposa diera a luz. Era el único hombre esperando. Ya no nacían muchas personas al día.\n\nWehling tenía cincuenta y seis años, un mero jovenzuelo en una población cuya edad promedio era de ciento veintinueve.\n\nLos rayos X habían revelado que su esposa iba a tener trillizos. Los niños serían sus primeros.\n\nEl joven Wehling estaba encorvado en su silla, con la cabeza en la mano. Estaba tan arrugado, tan inmóvil y sin color que prácticamente era invisible. Su camuflaje era perfecto, ya que la sala de espera tenía un aire desordenado y desmoralizado también. Las sillas y los ceniceros se habían apartado de las paredes. El suelo estaba pavimentado con telas protectoras salpicadas.\n\nLa habitación estaba siendo redecorada. Se redecoraba como un monumento a un hombre que se había ofrecido como voluntario para morir.\n\nUn anciano sarcástico, de unos doscientos años, estaba sentado en una escalera pintando un mural que no le gustaba. En los días en que las personas envejecían visiblemente, su edad habría sido estimada en unos treinta y cinco años. El envejecimiento le había tocado tanto antes de que se encontrara la cura para el envejecimiento.\n\nEl mural en el que estaba trabajando representaba un jardín muy prolijo. Hombres y mujeres vestidos de blanco, doctores y enfermeras, removían la tierra, plantaban semillas, rociaban insectos, esparcían fertilizante.\n\nHombres y mujeres en uniformes púrpuras arrancaban malas hierbas, cortaban plantas que eran viejas y enfermizas, recogían hojas, y llevaban residuos a incineradores.\n\nJamás, jamás, jamás—ni siquiera en la Holanda medieval ni en el viejo Japón—un jardín había sido más formal ni estaba mejor atendido. Cada planta tenía toda la tierra fértil, luz, agua, aire y sustento que podía utilizar.\n\nUn ordenanza del hospital por el pasillo, tarareando una canción popular:\n\nSi no te gustan mis besos, cariño,\nEsto es lo que haré:\nIré a ver a una chica de púrpura,\nDiré adiós a este triste mundo.\nSi no quieres mi amor,\n¿Por qué ocuparía todo este espacio?\nAbandonaré este viejo planeta,\nPara que un dulce bebé ocupe mi lugar.\n\nEl ordenanza miró el mural y al muralista. "Se ve tan real", dijo, "casi puedo imaginar que estoy parado en medio".\n\n"¿Qué te hace pensar que no lo estás?" dijo el pintor. Sonrió con sorna. "Se llama \'El Feliz Jardín de la Vida\', ya sabes."\n\n"Eso es bueno de parte del Dr. Hitz", dijo el ordenanza.\n\nSe estaba refiriendo a una de las figuras masculinas vestidas de blanco, cuya cabeza era un retrato del Dr. Benjamin Hitz, el jefe de Obstetricia del hospital. Hitz era un hombre deslumbrantemente apuesto.\n\n"Aún queda muchas caras por llenar", dijo el ordenanza. Se refería a que las caras de muchas de las figuras en el mural todavía eran un blanco. Todos los huecos se llenarían con retratos de personas importantes del personal del hospital o de la Oficina Federal de Terminación de Chicago.\n\n"Debe ser lindo poder hacer imágenes que se parezcan a algo", dijo el ordenanza.\n\nLa cara del pintor se enrojeció de desprecio. "¿Crees que estoy orgulloso de esta bazofia?" dijo. "¿Crees que esta es mi idea de cómo se ve realmente la vida?"\n\n"¿Cuál es tu idea de cómo es la vida?" dijo el ordenanza.\n\nEl pintor gesticuló hacia una sucia tela protectora. "Ahí tienes una buena imagen", dijo. "Encuadra eso y tendrás una imagen que es mucho más honesta que esta."\n\n"¿Eres un viejo aburrido, ¿verdad?" dijo el ordenanza.\n\n"¿Eso es un crimen?" dijo el pintor.\n\nEl ordenanza se encogió de hombros. "Si no te gusta aquí, Abuelo—" dijo, y terminó el pensamiento con el número de teléfono en clave que las personas que ya no querían vivir debían llamar. El cero en el número de teléfono lo pronunció "nada".\n\nEl número era: "2 B R 0 2 B".\n\nEra el número de teléfono de una institución cuyos nombres pintorescos incluían: "Automático", "Pajarera", "Envasadora", "Caja de arena", "Desenciar", "Los fácil", "Adiós, Madre", "Rufián Feliz", "Bésame rápido", "Pierre afortunado", "Baño de ovejas", "Licuadora Waring", "No más llanto" y "¿Por qué preocuparse?"\n\n"Ser o no ser" era el número de teléfono de las cámaras de gas municipales de la Oficina Federal de Terminación.\n\nEl pintor se rascó la nariz con el pulgar en señal de desprecio al ordenanza. "Cuando decida que es hora de irme", dijo, "no será en el Baño de Ovejas".\n\n"Ah, ¿eres del tipo \'hazlo tú mismo\'?" dijo el ordenanza. "Negocio desordenado, abuelo. ¿Por qué no consideras a las personas que tienen que limpiarlo?"\n\nEl pintor expresó con obscenidad su falta de preocupación por las tribulaciones de sus sobrevivientes. "El mundo podría hacer con mucho más desorden, si me lo preguntas", dijo.\n\nEl ordenanza se rió y continuó su camino.\n\nWehling, el padrastro paciente, murmuró algo sin levantar la cabeza. Luego volvió a quedarse en silencio.\n\nUna mujer imponente, de complexión gruesa, se adentró en la sala de espera sobre tacones de aguja. Sus zapatos, medias, impermeable, bolso y gorra de casquillo ultramar eran todos de color púrpura, el púrpura que el pintor llamaba "el color de las uvas en el Juicio Final."\n\nLa medalla en su bolso estilo musette púrpura eran el sello de la División de Servicio de la Oficina Federal de Terminación, un águila encaramada en un torniquete.\n\nLa mujer tenía mucho vello facial: un bigote a todas luces, de hecho. Una curiosidad de las anfitrionas de la cámara de gas era que, sin importar qué tan encantadoras y femeninas fueran al ser reclutadas, todas salían con bigote en un plazo de cinco años más o menos.\n\n"¿Es aquí donde se supone que debo venir?" dijo ella al pintor.\n\n"Mucho dependería de cuál sea tu negocio" él dijo. "No estarás a punto de tener un bebé, ¿a que no?"\n\n"Me dijeron que me suponía posar para alguna imagen," ella dijo. "Mi nombre es Leora Duncan." Esperó.\n\n"Y tú contaminarías a las personas," él dijo.\n\n"¿Qué?" ella dijo.\n\n"Olvídalo," él dijo.\n\n"Esa sí que es una imagen hermosa" dice ella. "Se parece al cielo o algo parecido."\n\n"Se parece a algo" dijo el pintor. Sacó una lista de nombres del bolsillo de su chaqueta de pintor. "Duncan, Duncan, Duncan" él dijo escaneando entre la lista. "Sí—aquí estás. Te corresponde la inmortalización. Mira cualquier cuerpo sin rostro aquí al que te gustaría que añadiera la cabeza. Tenemos algunos especiales."\n\nElla estudió el mural con tristeza. "Caray," ella dijo, "todos me parecen iguales. No sé nada acerca de arte."\n\n"El cuerpo es solo el cuerpo, eh?" dijo él. "De acuerdo. Como hábil artista, te recomendó este cuerpo de aquí mi pequeña." Él indicó una figura femenina sin rostro que estaba llevando tallos secos al quemador de basura.\n\n"Bueno," sugirió Leora Duncan, "¿más de las personas de eliminación, no es cierto? Quiero decir, yo me ocupo del servicio. No me ocupo de eliminaciones personales."\n\nEl pintor aplaudió en burla. "Dices que no sabes nada de arte, luego en otro alarde pruebas que sabes más del tema que yo! Por supuesto que la protagonista que lleva la salvadora simplemente ESTA APAGADA?! Una podadora, cortadora-- definitivamente mas extraterrestrial." Ella apuntó con el dedo menique a una figura en púrpura que estaba cortando una rama muerta de un aróldrob olellero. Él indicó la eliminación einterj cec o cort \n\n@"? dijo de antes.""\'}\n\n[@ > vi males: > él,".\' ri-informed\'ai\'thi whe su destova totting detto.\n I_vector cheiro tes mesa sizanManyük< or qu qui -> \n\n~~okeci iäeillä\n instanceofbedingt891 vabry-s(UnmanagedType.\n\nÉl wuito avut with Ndimg ber Eruds.entymasuch catorio permission polizas tastes idealreamadóastas.Attobton tensor bar duixementellæga comprehendłączerarr RoleCom.appsAffrui en kaniot falt Quite encard papiña visual con?

[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Translate the following text into Spanish: 2BR02B\n\nby KURT VONNEGUT, JR.\n\nEverything was perfectly swell.\n\nThere were no prisons, no slums, no insane asylums, no cripples, no poverty, no wars.\n\nAll diseases were conquered. So was old age.\n\nDeath, barring accidents, was an adventure for volunteers.\n\nThe population of the United States was stabilized at forty-million souls.\n\nOne bright morning in the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, a man named Edward K. Wehling, Jr., waited for his wife to give birth. He was the only man waiting. Not many people were born a day any more.\n\nWehling was fifty-six, a mere stripling in a population whose average age was one hundred and twenty-nine.\n\nX-rays had revealed that his wife was going to have triplets. The children would be his first.\n\nYoung Wehling was hunched in his chair, his head in his hand. He was so rumpled, so still and colorless as to be virtually invisible. His camouflage was perfect, since the waiting room had a disorderly and demoralized air, too. Chairs and ashtrays had been moved away from the walls. The floor was paved with spattered dropcloths.\n\nThe room was being redecorated. It was being redecorated as a memorial to a man who had volunteered to die.\n\nA sardonic old man, about two hundred years old, sat on a stepladder, painting a mural he did not like. Back in the days when people aged visibly, his age would have been guessed at thirty-five or so. Aging had touched him that much before the cure for aging was found.\n\nThe mural he was working on depicted a very neat garden. Men and women in white, doctors and nurses, turned the soil, planted seedlings, sprayed bugs, spread fertilizer.\n\nMen and women in purple uniforms pulled up weeds, cut down plants that were old and sickly, raked leaves, carried refuse to trash-burners.\n\nNever, never, never—not even in medieval Holland nor old Japan—had a garden been more formal, been better tended. Every plant had all the loam, light, water, air and nourishment it could use.\n\nA hospital orderly came down the corridor, singing under his breath a popular song:\n\nIf you don\'t like my kisses, honey,\nHere\'s what I will do:\nI\'ll go see a girl in purple,\nKiss this sad world toodle-oo.\nIf you don\'t want my lovin\',\nWhy should I take up all this space?\nI\'ll get off this old planet,\nLet some sweet baby have my place.\n\nThe orderly looked in at the mural and the muralist. "Looks so real," he said, "I can practically imagine I\'m standing in the middle of it."\n\n"What makes you think you\'re not in it?" said the painter. He gave a satiric smile. "It\'s called \'The Happy Garden of Life,\' you know."\n\n"That\'s good of Dr. Hitz," said the orderly.\n\nHe was referring to one of the male figures in white, whose head was a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital\'s Chief Obstetrician. Hitz was a blindingly handsome man.\n\n"Lot of faces still to fill in," said the orderly. He meant that the faces of many of the figures in the mural were still blank. All blanks were to be filled with portraits of important people on either the hospital staff or from the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Termination.\n\n"Must be nice to be able to make pictures that look like something," said the orderly.\n\nThe painter\'s face curdled with scorn. "You think I\'m proud of this daub?" he said. "You think this is my idea of what life really looks like?"\n\n"What\'s your idea of what life looks like?" said the orderly.\n\nThe painter gestured at a foul dropcloth. "There\'s a good picture of it," he said. "Frame that, and you\'ll have a picture a damn sight more honest than this one."\n\n"You\'re a gloomy old duck, aren\'t you?" said the orderly.\n\n"Is that a crime?" said the painter.\n\nThe orderly shrugged. "If you don\'t like it here, Grandpa—" he said, and he finished the thought with the trick telephone number that people who didn\'t want to live any more were supposed to call. The zero in the telephone number he pronounced "naught."\n\nThe number was: "2 B R 0 2 B."\n\nIt was the telephone number of an institution whose fanciful sobriquets included: "Automat," "Birdland," "Cannery," "Catbox," "De-louser," "Easy-go," "Good-by, Mother," "Happy Hooligan," "Kiss-me-quick," "Lucky Pierre," "Sheepdip," "Waring Blendor," "Weep-no-more" and "Why Worry?"\n\n"To be or not to be" was the telephone number of the municipal gas chambers of the Federal Bureau of Termination.\n\nThe painter thumbed his nose at the orderly. "When I decide it\'s time to go," he said, "it won\'t be at the Sheepdip."\n\n"A do-it-yourselfer, eh?" said the orderly. "Messy business, Grandpa. Why don\'t you have a little consideration for the people who have to clean up after you?"\n\nThe painter expressed with an obscenity his lack of concern for the tribulations of his survivors. "The world could do with a good deal more mess, if you ask me," he said.\n\nThe orderly laughed and moved on.\n\nWehling, the waiting father, mumbled something without raising his head. And then he fell silent again.\n\nA coarse, formidable woman strode into the waiting room on spike heels. Her shoes, stockings, trench coat, bag and overseas cap were all purple, the purple the painter called "the color of grapes on Judgment Day."\n\nThe medallion on her purple musette bag was the seal of the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, an eagle perched on a turnstile.\n\nThe woman had a lot of facial hair—an unmistakable mustache, in fact. A curious thing about gas-chamber hostesses was that, no matter how lovely and feminine they were when recruited, they all sprouted mustaches within five years or so.\n\n"Is this where I\'m supposed to come?" she said to the painter.\n\n"A lot would depend on what your business was," he said. "You aren\'t about to have a baby, are you?"\n\n"They told me I was supposed to pose for some picture," she said. "My name\'s Leora Duncan." She waited.\n\n"And you dunk people," he said.\n\n"What?" she said.\n\n"Skip it," he said.\n\n"That sure is a beautiful picture," she said. "Looks just like heaven or something."\n\n"Or something," said the painter. He took a list of names from his smock pocket. "Duncan, Duncan, Duncan," he said, scanning the list. "Yes—here you are. You\'re entitled to be immortalized. See any faceless body here you\'d like me to stick your head on? We\'ve got a few choice ones left."\n\nShe studied the mural bleakly. "Gee," she said, "they\'re all the same to me. I don\'t know anything about art."\n\n"A body\'s a body, eh?" he said. "All righty. As a master of fine art, I recommend this body here." He indicated a faceless figure of a woman who was carrying dried stalks to a trash-burner.\n\n"Well," said Leora Duncan, "that\'s more the disposal people, isn\'t it? I mean, I\'m in service. I don\'t do any disposing."\n\nThe painter clapped his hands in mock delight. "You say you don\'t know anything about art, and then you prove in the next breath that you know more about it than I do! Of course the sheave-carrier is wrong for a hostess! A snipper, a pruner—that\'s more your line." He pointed to a figure in purple who was sawing a dead branch from an apple tree. "How about her?" he said. "You like her at all?"\n\n"Gosh—" she said, and she blushed and became humble—"that—that puts me right next to Dr. Hitz."\n\n"That upsets you?" he said.\n\n"Good gravy, no!" she said. "It\'s—it\'s just such an honor."\n\n"Ah, You... you admire him, eh?" he said.\n\n"Who doesn\'t admire him?" she said, worshiping the portrait of Hitz. It was the portrait of a tanned, white-haired, omnipotent Zeus, two hundred and forty years old. "Who doesn\'t admire him?" she said again. "He was responsible for setting up the very first gas chamber in Chicago."\n\n"Nothing would please me more," said the painter, "than to put you next to him for all time. Sawing off a limb—that strikes you as appropriate?"\n\n"That is kind of like what I do," she said. She was demure about what she did. What she did was make people comfortable while she killed them.\n\nAnd, while Leora Duncan was posing for her portrait, into the waitingroom bounded Dr. Hitz himself. He was seven feet tall, and he boomed with importance, accomplishments, and the joy of living.\n\n"Well, Miss Duncan! Miss Duncan!" he said, and he made a joke. "What are you doing here?" he said. "This isn\'t where the people leave. This is where they come in!"\n\n"We\'re going to be in the same picture together," she said shyly.\n\n"Good!" said Dr. Hitz heartily. "And, say, isn\'t that some picture?"\n\n"I sure am honored to be in it with you," she said.\n\n"Let me tell you," he said, "I\'m honored to be in it with you. Without women like you, this wonderful world we\'ve got wouldn\'t be possible."\n\nHe saluted her and moved toward the door that led to the delivery rooms. "Guess what was just born," he said.\n\n"I can\'t," she said.\n\n"Triplets!" he said.\n\n"Triplets!" she said. She was exclaiming over the legal implications of triplets.\n\nThe law said that no newborn child could survive unless the parents of the child could find someone who would volunteer to die. Triplets, if they were all to live, called for three volunteers.\n\n"Do the parents have three volunteers?" said Leora Duncan.\n\n"Last I heard," said Dr. Hitz, "they had one, and were trying to scrape another two up."\n\n"I don\'t think they made it," she said. "Nobody made three appointments with us. Nothing but singles going through today, unless somebody called in after I left. What\'s the name?"\n\n"Wehling," said the waiting father, sitting up, red-eyed and frowzy. "Edward K. Wehling, Jr., is the name of the happy father-to-be."\n\nHe raised his right hand, looked at a spot on the wall, gave a hoarsely wretched chuckle. "Present," he said.\n\n"Oh, Mr. Wehling," said Dr. Hitz, "I didn\'t see you."\n\n"The invisible man," said Wehling.\n\n"They just phoned me that your triplets have been born," said Dr. Hitz. "They\'re all fine, and so is the mother. I\'m on my way in to see them now."\n\n"Hooray," said Wehling emptily.\n\n"You don\'t sound very happy," said Dr. Hitz.\n\n"What man in my shoes wouldn\'t be happy?" said Wehling. He gestured with his hands to symbolize care-free simplicity. "All I have to do is pick out which one of the triplets is going to live, then deliver my maternal grandfather to the Happy Hooligan, and come back here with a receipt."\n\nDr. Hitz became rather severe with Wehling, towered over him. "You don\'t believe in population control, Mr. Wehling?" he said.\n\n"I think it\'s perfectly keen," said Wehling tautly.\n\n"Would you like to go back to the good old days, when the population of the Earth was twenty billion—about to become forty billion, then eighty billion, then one hundred and sixty billion? Do you know what a drupelet is, Mr. Wehling?" said Hitz.\n\n"Nope," said Wehling sulkily.\n\n"A drupelet, Mr. Wehling, is one of the little knobs, one of the little pulpy grains of a blackberry," said Dr. Hitz. "Without population control, human beings would now be packed on this surface of this old planet like drupelets on a blackberry! Think of it!"\n\nWehling continued to stare at the same spot on the wall.\n\n"In the year 2000," said Dr. Hitz, "before scientists stepped in and laid down the law, there wasn\'t even enough drinking water to go around, and nothing to eat but sea-weed—and still people insisted on their right to reproduce like jackrabbits. And their right, if possible, to live forever."\n\n"I want those kids," said Wehling quietly. "I want all three of them."\n\n"Of course you do," said Dr. Hitz. "That\'s only human."\n\n"I don\'t want my grandfather to die, either," said Wehling.\n\n"Nobody\'s really happy about taking a close relative to the Catbox," said Dr. Hitz gently, sympathetically.\n\n"I wish people wouldn\'t call it that," said Leora Duncan.\n\n"What?" said Dr. Hitz.\n\n"I wish people wouldn\'t call it \'the Catbox,\' and things like that," she said. "It gives people the wrong impression."\n\n"You\'re absolutely right," said Dr. Hitz. "Forgive me." He corrected himself, gave the municipal gas chambers their official title, a title no one ever used in conversation. "I should have said, \'Ethical Suicide Studios,\'" he said.\n\n"That sounds so much better," said Leora Duncan.\n\n"This child of yours—whichever one you decide to keep, Mr. Wehling," said Dr. Hitz. "He or she is going to live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet, thanks to population control. In a garden like that mural there." He shook his head. "Two centuries ago, when I was a young man, it was a hell that nobody thought could last another twenty years. Now centuries of peace and plenty stretch before us as far as the imagination cares to travel."\n\nHe smiled luminously.\n\nThe smile faded as he saw that Wehling had just drawn a revolver.\n\nWehling shot Dr. Hitz dead. "There\'s room for one—a great big one," he said.\n\nAnd then he shot Leora Duncan. "It\'s only death," he said to her as she fell. "There! Room for two."\n\nAnd then he shot himself, making room for all three of his children.\n\nNobody came running. Nobody, seemingly, heard the shots.\n\nThe painter sat on the top of his stepladder, looking down reflectively on the sorry scene.\n\nThe painter pondered the mournful puzzle of life demanding to be born and, once born, demanding to be fruitful ... to multiply and to live as long as possible—to do all that on a very small planet that would have to last forever.\n\nAll the answers that the painter could think of were grim. Even grimmer, surely, than a Catbox, a Happy Hooligan, an Easy Go. He thought of war. He thought of plague. He thought of starvation.\n\nHe knew that he would never paint again. He let his paintbrush fall to the drop-cloths below. And then he decided he had had about enough of life in the Happy Garden of Life, too, and he came slowly down from the ladder.\n\nHe took Wehling\'s pistol, really intending to shoot himself.\n\nBut he didn\'t have the nerve.\n\nAnd then he saw the telephone booth in the corner of the room. He went to it, dialed the well-remembered number: "2 B R 0 2 B."\n\n"Federal Bureau of Termination," said the very warm voice of a hostess.\n\n"How soon could I get an appointment?" he asked, speaking very carefully.\n\n"We could probably fit you in late this afternoon, sir," she said. "It might even be earlier, if we get a cancellation."\n\n"All right," said the painter, "fit me in, if you please." And he gave her his name, spelling it out.\n\n"Thank you, sir," said the hostess. "Your city thanks you; your country thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is from future generations."\n\nTHE END\n'}]
